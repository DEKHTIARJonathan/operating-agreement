 MEMBERSHIP; DISPOSITIONS OF INTERESTS

**Members**.

    1.
### **General**. The Members of the Company are those Persons set forth on the signature pages hereto, who are admitted to the Company as Members effective contemporaneously with the execution by such Persons of this Agreement. The Members, their number of Units and other relevant information are set forth in Exhibit A. Each Member's Membership Interests in the Company shall represented by its Capital Account and by Units issued by the Company to such Member. Such Units shall consist of three classes of Units, referred to as Class A Units, Class B Units, and Class F Units. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event does the Company guarantee any particular tax result with regard to any interest in the Company.
    2.
### **Units Generally**. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, each holder of Class A Units or Class B Units shall be entitled to one vote for each Class A Unit or Class B Unit held by such Member on matters to be voted on by the Members.
    3.
### **Class F Units; Profits Interests**. The Class F Units are non-voting; therefore, Class F Members shall not be entitled to vote on any matter under this Agreement or relating in any way to the Company. Each Class F Member hereby acknowledges and agrees that, except as otherwise set forth herein, such Class F Member will have no voting rights with respect to their Class F Units, respectively, including no voting rights related to the operations of the Company, the making of distributions with respect to such Member's Class F Units, respectively, the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, the conversion or merger or fundamental business transaction of the Company, or the cessation of the operations of the Company, including the winding up and termination of the Company. As a condition to a Class F Member's receipt of the Class F Units, if the Class F Units are given any right to vote on any matter under any law from time to time in effect, including with respect to fundamental business transactions (as defined in the Business Code) and amendments to the Certificate, such Class F Member hereby agrees to vote its Class F Units on such matters as directed by the Managers and each Class F Member hereby irrevocably appoints the Managers as such Class F Member's proxy to vote such nonvoting the Class F Units. Such proxy is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked. The Class F Units are intended to constitute profits interests. Absent a contrary determination by the Managers following the Effective Date based on a change in applicable law governing the taxation of "profits interests" or based on the facts regarding a particular grant (i) the Company and each Member shall treat each Class F Unit as a "profits interest" within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 93 27, 1993-2 C.B. 343, as clarified by Rev. Proc. 2001-43, 2001-2 C.B. 191; (ii) the Company and each Member shall treat each holder of a Class F Unit as the owner of such interests from the date such interests are granted until such interests are forfeited or otherwise disposed of; (iii) each holder of a Class F Unit agrees to take into account such distributive share of the Company's income, gain, deduction and loss in computing its United States federal income tax liability for the entire period during which it holds such interests; and (iv) the Company and each Member agree not to claim a deduction (as wages, compensation or otherwise) for the fair market value of any Class F Unit either upon grant or vesting of the Class F Unit. Upon a change in applicable law governing the taxation of "profits interests," each Member shall take such actions as may be reasonably requested by the Company in response to such change in law, including agreeing to amend this Agreement in a manner the Partnership Representative deems necessary or appropriate to reflect such change in law and reporting any such matters in their income tax returns as reasonably determined by the Partnership Representative. Class F Units may be issued in series of Class F Units (e.g., Series 1, Series 2, etc.) with varying terms and conditions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in no event does the Company guarantee any particular tax result with regard to any interest in the Company. Immediately prior to each issuance of Class F Units, the Managers shall determine the Distribution Threshold. In each Award Agreement or similar award agreement that the Company enters into with a Class F Member for the issuance of new Class F Units, the Managers shall include an appropriate Distribution Threshold for such Class F Units at least equal to the Distribution Threshold immediately prior to the issuance of such Class F Units. The Managers is hereby authorized and empowered, without further vote or action of the Members, to amend this Agreement as reasonably necessary to comply with the requirements of, or address changes to, any law applicable to the taxation of "profits interests."
    4.
### **Incentive Plans**. The issuance and ownership of any Class F Units shall be governed by this Agreement and any applicable Award Agreements, including all such terms, conditions and restrictions set forth therein. The Managers may adopt one or more incentive plans or compensation agreements (each, an "_ **Incentive Plan** _") for the benefit of any existing or prospective consultants, employees, officers, managers or other service providers of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (each, a "_ **Service Provider** _"). Upon the Managers' authorization, the Company may enter into agreements with each Service Provider (each an "_ **Award Agreement** _"). Each Award Agreement may include non-competition and non-solicitation restrictions, vesting criteria, Company repurchase options and/or forfeiture provisions, as determined in the discretion of the Managers. The Company may issue Class F Units of the Company or a Company Subsidiary pursuant to an Incentive Plan or Award Agreement, or which may be fully vested upon issuance; provided that all Class F Units shall be non-voting. This Agreement may be amended by the Managers to reflect the issuance of any such Class F Units, including any intent that such Class F Units constitute "profits interests" in the Company within the meaning of Rev. Proc. 93-27 and Rev. Proc. 2001-43, for services rendered or to be rendered to the Company by the recipient.

      1.
#### Unless otherwise set forth in the Award Agreement pursuant to which such Class F Units are granted, (A) such Class F Units shall initially be unvested, (B) 25% of such Class F Units shall vest on each anniversary of the date of issuance of such Class F Units, and (C) any such Class F Units that remain unvested on the date that the holder of such Class F Units ceases to be a Service Provider to the Company shall immediately and automatically be forfeited.
      2.
#### Any Class F Units that are authorized and not yet issued and any Class F Units issued and subsequently forfeited or reacquired by the Company shall remain available for future issuances in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
      3.
#### **Section 83(b) Elections**. Each Person who is issued Class F Units (or other Units) under an Incentive Plan that are substantially nonvested, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.83-3(b), at the time of issuance agrees to file a valid and timely election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to such Units and provide a copy of the election to the Company.

    2.
### if such Member is a limited liability company, it is duly organized, validly existing, and (if applicable) in good standing under the law of the state of its organization and is duly qualified and (if applicable) in good standing as a foreign limited liability company in the jurisdiction of its principal place of business (if not organized therein);

### if such Member is a partnership, trust, or other entity, it is duly formed, validly existing, and (if applicable) in good standing under the law of the state of its formation, and if required by law is duly qualified to do business and (if applicable) in good standing in the jurisdiction of its principal place of business (if not formed therein), and the representations and warranties in clause (a), (b), or (c), as applicable, are true and correct with respect to each partner, trustee, or other member thereof;
    4.
### such Member has full corporate, limited liability company, partnership, trust, or other applicable power and authority to execute and agree to this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and all necessary actions by the board of directors, shareholders, managers, members, partners, trustees, beneficiaries, or other Persons necessary for the due authorization, execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement by that Member have been duly taken;
    5.
### such Member has duly executed and delivered this Agreement; and
    6.
### such Member's authorization, execution, delivery, and performance of this Agreement do not conflict with any other agreement or arrangement to which that Member is a party or by which it is bound.

**Admission of Additional Members**. Additional Persons may be admitted to the Company as Members, and Units (or options or warrants exercisable for Units or other securities convertible into Units) may be issued to those Persons with approval of the Managers, on such terms and conditions as the Managers may determine at the time of admission. Any such admission shall be effective only after the new Member (and such Member's spouse, as applicable) has executed and delivered to the Company a Consent and Certification. Upon admission of a new Member pursuant to this ARTICLE III, the Sharing Ratio of each Member shall be adjusted in accordance with the Members' previous Sharing Ratios, and the Company shall amend Exhibit A, and, if appropriate, any other provision of this Agreement, to reflect the addition of the new Member and the adjustment in the Sharing Ratios and the rights and preferences of the Members after such issuance and any other rights and preferences applicable to the Units (or options, warrants, or convertible securities). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure of the Company to amend Exhibit A shall not prevent the effectiveness of or otherwise affect the underlying adjustments that would be reflected in such an amendment to Exhibit A. The Managers are hereby authorized to make any other adjustments contemplated by this Section 3.3 to the Capital Accounts and distribution provisions of this Agreement as necessary to reflect the intent of the Members as described in this Section 3.3.

**Restrictions on the Transfer of Units**. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement, a Transfer of Units may not be effected except (a) in compliance with the applicable provisions of this ARTICLE III and (b) with the consent of the Managers. Class F Units may not be Transferred. Any attempted Transfer by a Person of an interest or right, or any part thereof, in or in respect of the Company other than in accordance with this Agreement shall be, and is hereby declared, invalid and null and void _ab initio_; in enforcing this provision, the Company may hold and refuse to Transfer any Units in addition and without prejudice to any and all other rights or remedies which may be available to the Company.

**Transfers Generally**.

    1.
### Subject to the provisions of Sections 3.5(b), (c), and (d), a Person to whom any Units are Transferred in accordance with this Agreement has the right to be admitted to the Company as a Member with the Units and Sharing Ratio so Transferred to such Person, only if such Transfer is consented to in accordance with this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, Transfers by a Member made pursuant to Sections 3.6 through 3.12 do not require the specific approval of the Transferring Member, the other Members, or the Managers, but such Transfers do require compliance with the provisions of Sections 3.5(b), (c), and (d).
    2.
### The Company shall be entitled to not recognize any purported Transfer of Units unless and until the other applicable provisions of this Section 3.5 have been satisfied and the Managers have received, on behalf of the Company, a document (i) executed by both the Member effecting the Transfer and the transferee (and such transferee's spouse, as applicable), (ii) including the notice address of any transferee to be admitted to the Company as a Member and its agreement to be bound by this Agreement in respect of the Units being obtained, (iii) setting forth the Sharing Ratios after the Transfer of the Member effecting the Transfer and the transferee (which together must total the Sharing Ratio of the Member effecting the Transfer before such Transfer), and (iv) containing a representation and warranty that the Transfer was made in accordance with all applicable laws and regulations (including federal and state securities laws) and, if the transferee is to be admitted to the Company, its representation and warranty that the representations and warranties in Section 3.2 are true and correct with respect to that Person. Each Transfer and, if applicable, admission complying with the provisions of this Section 3.5(b) is effective as of the first day of the calendar month immediately succeeding the month in which the Company receives the notification of Transfer and the other requirements of this Section 3.5 have been met.
    3.
### For the right of a Member to Transfer Units, or of any Person to be admitted to the Company in connection therewith, to exist or be exercised, (i) either (A) the Units subject to the Transfer or admission must be registered under the Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws or (B) the Managers have determined that the Transfer or admission is exempt from registration under those laws and (ii) the Company must receive a favorable opinion of the Company's legal counsel or of other legal counsel acceptable to the Managers to the effect that the Transfer or admission, when added to the total of all other sales, assignments, or other Transfers within the preceding 12 months, would not result in the Company's being considered to have terminated within the meaning of Section 708 of the Code. The Managers, however, may at their discretion elect to waive the requirements of this Section 3.5(c).
    4.
### The Member effecting a Transfer and any Person admitted to the Company in connection therewith shall pay, or reimburse the Company for, all costs incurred by the Company in connection with the Transfer or admission (including the legal fees incurred in connection with the legal opinions referred to in Section 3.5(c)) on or before the 10th day after the receipt by such Member and such Person of the Company's invoice for the amount due. If payment is not made by the date due, the Persons owing that amount shall pay interest on the unpaid amount from the date due until paid at a rate per annum equal to the Default Interest Rate.

**Right of First Refusal**.

    1.
### **Option**. Each time a Member proposes to make a Transfer of any of its Units and pursuant to a bona fide offer from a third party (such third party having been approved by the Managers), such Member (the "_ **Seller** _") shall so inform the Company by notice in writing (the "_ **Redemption Notice** _") stating the number and type of Units that are the subject of such proposed Transfer (the "_ **Offered Units** _"), the identity of the proposed transferee, and the other terms and conditions of such proposed Transfer, including any consideration proposed to be received for the Offered Units (and, if the proposed Transfer is to be wholly or partly for consideration other than money, the Redemption Notice shall state the proposed price as being equal to the amount of the monetary consideration, if any, plus the Designated Fair Market Value of the other consideration, which valuation shall be subject to the Managers' approval) (collectively, and on a per Unit basis, the "_ **Redemption Amount** _"). The Company shall deliver a copy of the Redemption Notice to each Class A Member and Class B Member other than the Seller (the "_ **Remaining Members** _") within five days of receiving the Redemption Notice and the Company shall include on the copy of the Redemption Notice such date that the Company received the Redemption Notice. By giving the Redemption Notice, the Seller shall be deemed to have granted to the Company and the Remaining Members an option to purchase the Offered Units for the price and upon the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 3.6 and Section 3.14.
    2.
### **Election to Exercise by the Company**. On or before the 30th day following the date the Company receives the Redemption Notice (the "_ **Redemption Notice Date** _"), the Company shall notify the Seller and the Remaining Members of the amount of the Offered Units, if any, that the Company elects to purchase.
    3.
### **Election to Exercise by the Remaining Members**. If the Company purchases less than all of the Offered Units, each Remaining Member shall have until the 60th day following the Redemption Notice Date to notify the Seller and the Company of such Member's election to its _pro rata_ portion (determined by dividing (x) the Units held by such Member by (y) the total Units held by all Members), of the remaining Offered Units.
    4.
### **Manner of Exercise**. Upon determination of the amount of the Offered Units to be purchased by the Company and/or the Remaining Members, the Company, on the Company's behalf and on behalf of the Remaining Members who are purchasing the Offered Units, shall give notice of exercise to the Seller within 40 days after the Redemption Notice Date. Subject to Section 3.14(d), the Closing of any purchases made by the Company and/or the Remaining Members pursuant to this Section 3.6 will take place on the later of (i) the closing date specified in the Redemption Notice or (ii) 50 days after the Redemption Notice Date.
    5.

      4.
#### A Member that has more than one Membership Interest shall have a single Capital Account that reflects all its Membership Interests, regardless of the class of Membership Interests owned by that Member and regardless of the time or manner in which those Membership Interests were acquired.

      1.
#### Income of the Company that is exempt from federal income tax as described in Section 705(a)(1)(B) of the Code and not otherwise taken into account in computing Profits and Losses pursuant to this Section 4.5(b) shall be added to such taxable income or loss as if it were taxable income.

      3.
#### If the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to this Agreement, the amount of the adjustment shall be taken into account as gain or loss from the disposition of the asset for purposes of computing Profits and Losses.
      4.
#### Gain or loss resulting from any disposition of property with respect to which gain or loss is recognized for federal income tax purposes shall be computed by reference to the Gross Asset Value of the property disposed of, notwithstanding that the adjusted tax basis of the property differs from the Gross Asset Value of the property.

#### The Gross Asset Values of Company assets shall be increased (or decreased) to reflect any adjustment to the adjusted basis of such assets pursuant to Section 734(b) of the Code or Section 743(b) of the Code, but only to the extent that such adjustments are taken into account in determining Capital Accounts pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Treasury Regulations; provided, however, that Gross Asset Values shall not be adjusted pursuant to this Section 4.5(c)(iv) to the extent the Managers determine that an adjustment pursuant to Section 4.5(c)(ii) is necessary or appropriate in connection with a transaction that would otherwise result in an adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.5(c)(iv).
      5.

 ALLOCATIONS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

**Allocations**.

    1.
### **General Allocations**. After giving effect to the special allocations set forth in Section 5.3, Net Profit and Net Loss for any period shall be allocated among the persons who were Members during the relevant taxable year in a manner such that the Capital Account of each Member, immediately after giving effect to such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to the amount of the distribution that would be made to such Member if (i) the Company were wound up, liquidated and terminated; (ii) the affairs of the Company were wound up and each Company asset was sold for cash equal to its Gross Asset Value (except that any Company asset actually sold during the current year shall be treated as sold for the actual proceeds of the sale), (iii) all Company liabilities were satisfied and (iv) the net assets of the Company were distributed to the Members in accordance with Section 5.2(a) immediately after giving effect to such allocation.
    2.
### **Transfer**. All items of Profit, Loss, income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit allocable to any Membership Interest that may have been Transferred shall be allocated between the transferor Member and the transferee Member based on the portion of the calendar year during which each was recognized as owning that Membership Interest, without regard to the results of Company operations during any particular portion of that calendar year and without regard to whether cash distributions were made to the transferor Member or the transferee Member during that calendar year; provided, however, that this allocation must be made in accordance with a method permissible under Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

**Distributions**.

    1.
### **General**. From time to time (but at least once each calendar year) the Managers shall determine in its reasonable judgment to what extent (if any) the Company's cash on hand exceeds its current and anticipated needs, including for operating expenses, debt service, acquisitions, and a reasonable contingency reserve. Except as otherwise provided in ARTICLE XI, if such excess exists, the Managers may in their sole discretion cause the Company to distribute an amount in cash equal to that excess to the Members as follows:

      1.
#### First, to the Class A Members and Class B Members _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective relative Sharing Ratios until the Unreturned Capital Contribution Account of each such Member is reduced to zero; and
      2.
#### Thereafter, to the Members _pro rata_ in accordance with their Sharing Ratios.

      1.
#### Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5.2(a):

1.
#### Distributions under Section 5.2 shall be determined after giving effect to any concurrent repurchase or redemption of Units in accordance with this Agreement, any Award Agreement, or otherwise or to any other triggering event which results in the vesting of Class F Units. Subject to the foregoing, no distribution shall be made or accrued under this Agreement with respect to any unvested Class F Units.
2.
#### To the extent that at the time of any distribution under Section 5.2(a)(ii), any of the Class F Units are unvested, then any distributions that would otherwise be payable with respect to such unvested Class F Units under any or all of Section 5.2(a)(ii) shall not be paid to the applicable Class F Member but shall instead be redirected to, and distributed to, the holders of Class A Units and Class B Units _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective relative Sharing Ratios. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Managers may determine to retain all or any portion of such amount for later distribution to the relevant Class F Units at the time such Class F Units become vested (or, if later forfeited or repurchased, distribution to the holders of Class A Units and Class B Units _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective relative Sharing Ratios).
3.
#### No holder of Class F Units subject to a Distribution Threshold shall be entitled to receive any distributions pursuant to Section 5.2(a)(ii), in respect of any such Class F Unit unless and until cumulative distributions following the issuance of such Class F Units have been made under Section 5.2(a) in an aggregate amount equal to the applicable Distribution Threshold of such Class F Units to the Class A Units and Class F Units outstanding prior to the date such Class F Units were issued. The amount that would be distributable to any holder of Class F Units but for the application of the foregoing sentence shall be redirected and paid to the holders of Class A Units and Class B Units _pro rata_ in accordance with their respective relative Sharing Ratios.

    1.
### Notwithstanding Section 5.2(a), no distribution shall be made if, after giving effect to the distribution, all liabilities of the Company, other than liabilities to Members on account of their Membership Interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specified property of the Company, exceed the fair value of the assets of the Company, except that the fair value of property that is subject to a liability for which the recourse of creditors is limited shall be included in the assets of the Company only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds that liability.
    2.
### **Payments Not Deemed Distributions**. Any amounts paid pursuant to Section 6.8 or ARTICLE VIII shall not be deemed to be distributions for purposes of this Agreement.
    3.
### **Withheld Amounts**. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 5.2 to the contrary, each Member hereby authorizes the Company to withhold and to pay over, or otherwise pay, any withholding or other taxes payable by the Company with respect to the Member as a result of the Member's participation in the Company; if and to the extent that the Company shall be required to withhold or pay any such taxes, such Member shall be deemed for all purposes of this Agreement to have received a payment from the Company as of the time such withholding or tax is paid, which payment shall be deemed to be a distribution with respect to such Member's Membership Interest to the extent that the Member (or any successor to such Member's Membership Interest) is then entitled to receive a distribution. To the extent that the aggregate amount of such payments to a Member for any period exceeds the distributions to which such Member is entitled for such period, the amount of such excess shall be considered a loan from the Company to such Member. Such loan shall bear interest (which interest shall be treated as an item of income to the Company) at the General Interest Rate until discharged by such Member by repayment, which may be made by the Company out of distributions to which such Member would otherwise be subsequently entitled. Any withholdings authorized by this Section 5.2(d) shall be made at the maximum applicable statutory rate under the applicable tax law unless the Company shall have received an opinion of counsel or other evidence satisfactory to the Managers to the effect that a lower rate is applicable, or that no withholding is applicable.
    4.
### **Tax Distribution**. Except as otherwise provided in ARTICLE XI, the Managers may in their sole discretion and at its sole option cause the Company to make one or more distributions of cash to the Members with respect to each taxable year of the Company equal to the product of (x) such Member's allocable share (determined under ARTICLE V) of net taxable income for such taxable year (but reduced by any taxable losses allocated to the Member as determined under Section 5.1 in any prior periods, and not previously offset against taxable income hereunder), multiplied by (y) the tax rate determined by the Managers. At the discretion of the Managers, distributions pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) may be made periodically during the taxable year to correspond with the timing of any estimated tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service (or other taxing authority) required of the Members. Amounts distributed to a Member pursuant to this Section 5.2(e) shall be treated as an advance distribution to such Member of distributions pursuant to Section 5.2(a) and shall offset future distributions that such Member would otherwise be entitled to receive.

**Special Allocations of Profits and Losses**.

    1.
### **Special Allocations**.

      1.
#### _ **Qualified Income Offset** _. If any Member unexpectedly receives any adjustments, allocations, or distributions described in Sections 1.704-1(b)(ii)(d)(4), (5), or (6) of the Treasury Regulations, items of income and gain shall be specially allocated (on a gross basis) to each such Member in an amount and manner sufficient to eliminate, to the extent required by the Treasury Regulations, the Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of such Member as quickly as possible; provided, however, that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.3(a)(i) shall be made only if and to the extent that a Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this ARTICLE V have been tentatively made as if this Section 5.3(a)(i) were not in this Agreement. It is intended that this Section 5.3(a)(i) constitute a "qualified income offset" within the meaning of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Treasury Regulations and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent with such Treasury Regulations.
      2.
#### _ **Gross Income Allocation** _. If any Member has a deficit Capital Account at the end of any fiscal year, and such deficit Capital Account is in excess of the sum of (A) the amount such Member is obligated to restore pursuant to any provisions of this Agreement and (B) the amount such Member is deemed to be obligated to restore pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Sections 1.704-2(g)(l) and 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations, each such Member shall be specially allocated items of income and gain in the amount of such excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 5.3(a)(ii) shall be made only if and to the extent that such Member would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit in excess of such sum after all other allocations provided for in this ARTICLE V have been made as if Section 5.3(a)(i) hereof and this Section 5.3(a)(ii) were not in this Agreement.
      3.
#### _ **Minimum Gain Chargeback - Company Nonrecourse Liabilities** _. If there is a net decrease in Company Minimum Gain during any Company taxable year, certain items of income and gain shall be allocated (on a gross basis) to the Members in the amounts and manner described in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Treasury Regulations. This Section 5.3(a)(iii) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement (set forth in Section 1.704-2(f) of the Treasury Regulations) relating to Company nonrecourse liabilities (as defined in Section 1.704-2(b)(3) of the Treasury Regulations) and shall be so interpreted.
      4.
#### _ **Member Minimum Gain Chargeback - Member Nonrecourse Debt** _. If there is a net decrease in Member Minimum Gain during any Company taxable year, certain items of income and gain shall be allocated (on a gross basis) as quickly as possible to those Members who had a share of the Member Minimum Gain (determined pursuant to Section 1.704-2(i)(5) of the Treasury Regulations) in the amounts and manner described in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations. This Section 5.3(a)(iv) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement (set forth in Section 1.704-2(i)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) relating to Member nonrecourse debt (as defined in Section 1.704-2(b)(4) of the Treasury Regulations) and shall be so interpreted.
      5.
#### _ **Basis Adjustments** _. To the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any Company asset pursuant to Sections 734(b) or 743(b) of the Code is required, pursuant to Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m) of the Treasury Regulations, to be taken into account in determining Capital Accounts, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Members in a manner consistent with the manner in which their Capital Accounts are required to be adjusted pursuant to such Section of this Agreement.
      6.
#### _ **Member Nonrecourse Deductions** _. Member Nonrecourse Deductions shall be allocated in accordance with Section 1.704-2(i)(l) of the Treasury Regulations to the Member who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to such deductions. Each Nonrecourse Deduction (as defined in Section 1.704-2(b)(1) of the Treasury Regulations) of the Company shall be allocated to the Members in proportion to their relative Sharing Ratios.
      7.
#### _ **Allocation of Proceeds of Nonrecourse Liability** _. The determination of whether any distribution by the Company is allocable to the proceeds of a nonrecourse liability of the Company shall be made by the Managers under any reasonable method that is in compliance with Section 1.704-2(h) of the Treasury Regulations.
    2.
### **Curative Allocations**. The allocations set forth in Sections 5.1(a) and 5.3(a) hereof (the "_ **Regulatory Allocations** _") are intended to comply with certain requirements of Section 1.704-1(b) of the Treasury Regulations. The Members hereby acknowledge and agree that the Regulatory Allocations may not be consistent with the manner in which the Members intend to make Company distributions. Accordingly, the Managers are hereby authorized and directed to make other allocations of Profit, Loss, or Book Depreciation among the Members in any reasonable manner that the Managers deem appropriate, in its sole discretion, so as to prevent the Regulatory Allocations from distorting the manner in which the Company distributions would otherwise be divided among the Members pursuant to Sections 5.2 and 11.2 hereof. In general, the Members anticipate that this will be accomplished by specially allocating other Profits, Losses, or Book Depreciation among the Members so that, after such offsetting special allocations are made, the amount of each Member's Capital Account will be, to the extent possible, equal to the Capital Account balance such Member would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not a part of this Agreement and all Company items had been allocated to the Members solely pursuant to Section 5.1(a) hereof.
    3.
### **Tax Allocations: Code Section 704(c)**. In accordance with Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to any property contributed to the capital of the Company shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such property to the Company for federal income tax purposes and the initial Gross Asset Value of such property (determined in accordance with Section 4.5(c)(i) hereof). In accordance with the requirements of Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(i) of the Treasury Regulations, if the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is adjusted pursuant to Section 4.5(c)(ii) hereof, subsequent allocations of income, gain, loss, and deduction with respect to such asset shall take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for federal income tax purposes and the Gross Asset Value of such asset in the same manner as such variations are taken into account under Section 704(c) of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder with respect to property contributed to the Company. Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocation shall be made by the Managers in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and intention of this Agreement. Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.3(c) are solely for purposes of federal, state, and local taxes and shall not affect or be taken into account in computing any Member's Capital Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items, or distributions pursuant to this Agreement.
    4.
### **Other Allocation Rules**.

      1.
#### For purposes of determining the Profits, Losses, or any other item allocable to any period (including periods before and after the admission of a new Member), Profits, Losses, and any such other item shall be determined on a daily, monthly, or other basis, as determined and allocated by the Managers using any permissible method under Section 706 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.
      2.
#### For federal income tax purposes, every item of income, gain, loss, and deduction shall be allocated among the Members in accordance with the allocations under Sections 5.1, 5.3(a), 5.3(b), and 5.3(c).
      3.
#### The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the allocations made by this Section 5.3 and Section 5.1 and hereby agree to be bound by the provisions of this Section 5.3 and Section 5.1 in reporting their shares of Company income and loss for income tax purposes.
      4.
#### To the extent permissible under Section 704 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, in making allocations provided for in this Section 5.3 and Section 5.1, ordinary income realized by the Company from recapture of previously reported deductions shall be allocated to those Members (or their successors in interest) to whom such deductions were originally allocated and in proportion to such original allocations. Any obligation relating to the recapture of previously reported credits shall be allocated to those Members (or their successors in interest) to whom such credits were originally allocated and in proportion to such original allocations.
      5.
#### It is intended that the allocations in Sections 5.1, 5.3(a), 5.3(b), and 5.3(c) effect an allocation for federal income tax purposes consistent with Section 704 of the Code and comply with any limitations or restrictions therein. The Managers shall have complete discretion to make the allocations pursuant to this Section 5.3 and Section 5.1 in any reasonable manner consistent with Section 704 of the Code and to amend the provisions of this Agreement as appropriate to comply with the Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 704 of the Code, if in the opinion of counsel to the Company, such an amendment is advisable to reflect allocations among the Members consistent with those Treasury Regulations.
      6.
#### The Members agree that their Membership Interests represent their interests in Company profits for purposes of allocating excess nonrecourse liabilities pursuant to Section 1.752-3(a)(3) of the Treasury Regulations.

The Manager need not be a Member or resident of the State of Texas.

**Vacancies; Removal; Resignation**. Subject to other provisions of this Section, any vacancy among the Managers shall be filled by the Member(s) entitled to appoint the Manager whose absence results in such vacancy, pursuant to Section 6.3. A Manager elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected for the unexpired term of his or her predecessor in office. The Member(s) entitled to appoint a Manager pursuant to Section 6.3 may, at any time and with or without cause, terminate the term of office of such Manager by providing notice to the Company and such Manager. Such removal shall be effective immediately upon such Member action even if successors are not elected simultaneously, and the Manager vacancies caused by such action shall be filled pursuant to Section 6.3 and this Section 6.4. A Manager may resign at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by a Required Interest. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective, unless expressly so provided in the resignation.

**Approval or Ratification of Acts or Contracts by Members**. The Managers in their discretion may submit any act or contract for approval or ratification at any annual meeting of the Members, or at any special meeting of the Members called for the purpose of considering any such act or contract, and any act or contract that shall be approved or be ratified by a Required Interest shall be as valid and as binding upon the Company and upon all the Members as if it shall have been approved or ratified by every Manager and Member of the Company, unless the unanimous consent of the Members is required for such act or consent, in which case such unanimous consent must still be obtained. Failure of the Managers for any reason (or for no reason) to submit any act or contract to the Members for approval or ratification shall not in any way act to, or be deemed to, make such act or contract void or voidable.

**Action by Written Consent or Telephone Conference**. Any action permitted or required by the Business Code, the Certificate, or this Agreement to be taken at a meeting of the Managers or any committee designated by the Managers may be taken without a meeting if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, is signed by the Managers, or members of a committee designated by the Managers, as the case may be, having not less than the minimum number of votes required to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all such members entitled to vote thereon were present and voted. Such consent shall have the same force and effect as a unanimous vote at a meeting and may be stated as such in any document or instrument filed with the Secretary of State of Texas, and the execution of such consent shall constitute attendance or presence in person at a meeting of the Managers or any such committee, as the case may be. Subject to the requirements of the Business Code, the Certificate, or this Agreement for notice of meetings, unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate, Managers, or members of any committee designated by the Managers, may participate in and hold a meeting of the Managers or any committee, as the case may be, by means of a conference telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all Persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in such meeting shall constitute attendance and presence in person at such meeting, except where a Person participates in the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

**Officers**.

    1.
### **Generally**. The Managers may, from time to time, designate one or more Persons to be officers of the Company. No officer or agent need be a resident of the State of Texas, a Member, or a Manager. Any officer so designated shall have such authority and perform such duties as the Managers may, from time to time, delegate to that Person. The Managers may assign titles to particular officers of the Company. Unless the Managers decide otherwise, if the title is one commonly used for officers of a business corporation formed under the Business Code, the assignment of such title shall constitute the delegation to such officer of the authority and duties that are normally associated with that office, subject to (i) any specific delegation of authority and duties made to such officer by the Managers or (ii) any specific delegation of authority and duties made to the Managers or officers of the Company in this Agreement. Each officer of the Company shall hold office until his or her successor shall be duly designated and shall qualify, until his or her death, or until he or she shall resign or shall have been removed in the manner hereinafter provided. Any number of offices may be held by the same Person. The salaries or other compensation, if any, of the officers of the Company shall be fixed from time to time by the Managers.
    2.
### **Resignation; Removal**. Any officer may resign as such at any time. Such resignation shall be made in writing and shall take effect at the time specified therein, or if no time be specified, at the time of its receipt by the Managers. The acceptance of a resignation shall not be necessary to make it effective, unless expressly so provided in the resignation. Any officer may be removed as such, either with or without cause, by the Managers whenever in their judgment the best interests of the Company will be served thereby; provided, however, that such removal shall be without prejudice to the contract rights, if any, of the Person so removed.

**Reimbursement**. The Managers and the officers of the Company shall be entitled to be reimbursed for reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in the course of their service hereunder.

 MEETINGS OF MEMBERS

**Meetings**.

    1.
### A quorum shall be present at a meeting of Members if the holders of at least a Simple Majority are present or represented at the meeting in person or by proxy. With respect to any matter, other than a matter for which the affirmative vote of the holders of a specified portion of the Sharing Ratios of all Members entitled to vote is required by the Business Code or this Agreement, the affirmative vote of a Simple Majority at a meeting of Members at which a quorum is present shall be the act of the Members.
    2.
### All meetings of the Members shall be held at the principal place of business of the Company or at such other place within or without the State of Texas as shall be specified or fixed in the notices or waivers of notice thereof; provided that any or all Members may participate in any such meeting by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment, or other suitable electronic communications systems, pursuant to Section 7.5.

### Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Certificate or this Agreement, the chairman of the meeting or the holders of a Simple Majority shall have the power to adjourn such meeting from time to time, without any notice other than announcement at the meeting of the time and place of the holding of the adjourned meeting. If such meeting is adjourned by the Members, such time and place shall be determined by a vote of the holders of a Simple Majority. Upon the resumption of such adjourned meeting, any business may be transacted that might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called.
    4.
### In the sole discretion of the Managers, an annual meeting of the Members for the transaction of such business as may properly come before the meeting, may be held at such place, within or without the State of Texas, on such date, and at such time as the Managers shall fix and set forth in the notice of the meeting.
    5.
### Special meetings of the Members for any proper purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the Managers or the holders of at least ten percent (10%) of the Sharing Ratios of all Members. If not otherwise stated in or fixed in accordance with the remaining provisions hereof, the record date for determining Members entitled to call a special meeting is the date any Member first signs the notice of that meeting. Only business within the purpose or purposes described in the notice (or waiver thereof) required by this Agreement may be conducted at a special meeting of the Members.
    6.
### Written or printed notice stating the place, day, and hour of the meeting and, in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called, shall be delivered not less than 1 nor more than 10 days before the date of the meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the direction of the Managers or Person calling the meeting, to each Member entitled to vote at such meeting. If mailed, any such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the United States mail, addressed to the Member at his address provided for in Section 12.2, with postage thereon prepaid.
    7.
### The date on which notice of a meeting of Members is mailed or the date on which the resolution of the Managers declaring a distribution is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date for the determination of the Members entitled to notice of or to vote at such meeting, including any adjournment thereof, or the Members entitled to receive such distribution.

**Voting List**. The Managers shall make, at least 10 days before each meeting of Members, a complete list of the Members entitled to vote at such meeting or any adjournment thereof, arranged in alphabetical order, with the address of and the Sharing Ratios held by each, which list, for a period of 10 days prior to such meeting, shall be kept on file at the registered office or principal place of business of the Company and shall be subject to inspection by any Member at any time during usual business hours. Such list shall also be produced and kept open at the time and place of the meeting and shall be subject to the inspection of any Member during the whole time of the meeting. The original membership records shall be prima-facie evidence as to who are the Members entitled to examine such list or transfer records or to vote at any meeting of Members. Failure to comply with the requirements of this Section shall not affect the validity of any action taken at the meeting.

**Proxies**. A Member may vote either in person or by proxy executed in writing by the Member. A telegram, telex, cablegram, or similar transmission by the Member, or a photographic, photostatic, facsimile, electronic mail via portable document format (PDF), or similar reproduction of a writing executed by the Member shall be treated as an execution in writing for purposes of this Section. Proxies for use at any meeting of Members or in connection with the taking of any action by written consent shall be filed with the Managers, before or at the time of the meeting or execution of the written consent, as the case may be. All proxies shall be received and taken charge of and all ballots shall be received and canvassed by the Managers, who shall decide all questions touching upon the qualification of voters, the validity of the proxies, and the acceptance or rejection of votes, unless an inspector or inspectors shall have been appointed by the chairman of the meeting, in which event such inspector or inspectors shall decide all such questions. No proxy shall be valid after 11 months from the date of its execution unless otherwise provided in the proxy. A proxy shall be revocable unless the proxy form conspicuously states that the proxy is irrevocable and the proxy is coupled with an interest. Should a proxy designate two or more Persons to act as proxies, unless that instrument shall provide to the contrary, a majority of such Persons present at any meeting at which their powers thereunder are to be exercised shall have and may exercise all the powers of voting or giving consents thereby conferred, or if only one be present, then such powers may be exercised by that one; or, if an even number attend and a majority do not agree on any particular issue, the Company shall not be required to recognize such proxy with respect to such issue if such proxy does not specify how the Sharing Ratios that are the subject of such proxy are to be voted with respect to such issue.

**Conduct of Meetings**. All meetings of the Members shall be presided over by a chairman of the meeting, who shall be De Jean. The chairman of any meeting of Members shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including such regulation of the manner of voting and the conduct of discussion as seem to him in order.

**Action by Written Consent or Telephone Conference**.

    1.
### Any action required or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of Members may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by the holder or holders of not less than the minimum Sharing Ratios that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which the holders of all Sharing Ratios entitled to vote on the action were present and voted. No written consent shall be effective to take the action that is the subject to the consent unless, within 60 days after the date of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Company in the manner required by this Section, a consent or consents signed by the holder or holders of not less than the minimum Sharing Ratios that would be necessary to take the action that is the subject of the consent are delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office, its principal place of business, or the Managers. Delivery shall be by hand, certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by any other manner that the Managers authorize. Delivery to the Company's principal place of business shall be addressed to the De Jean. A telegram, telex, cablegram, or similar transmission by a Member, or a photographic, photostatic, facsimile, electronic mail via portable document format (PDF), or similar reproduction of a writing signed by a Member, shall be regarded as signed by the Member for purposes of this Section. Prompt notice of the taking of any action by Members without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those Members who did not consent in writing to the action.
    2.
### The record date for determining Members entitled to consent to action in writing without a meeting shall be the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Company by delivery to its registered office, its principal place of business, or the Managers.
    3.
### If any action by Members is taken by written consent, any articles or documents filed with the Secretary of State of Texas as a result of the taking of the action shall state, in lieu of any statement required by the Business Code concerning any vote of Members, that written consent has been given in accordance with the provisions of the Business Code and that any written notice required by the Business Code has been given.
    4.
### Members may participate in and hold a meeting by means of conference telephone or similar communications equipment, or another suitable electronic communications system (including video conferencing or the Internet), or any combination, by means of which all Persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and participation in such meeting shall constitute attendance and presence in person at such meeting, except where a Person participates in the meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business on the ground that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened.

 INDEMNIFICATION

**Right to Indemnification**. The Company shall indemnify, hold harmless, defend, pay and reimburse any persons who are or were a Manager or officer of the Company both in their capacities as Manager and officers of the Company and, if serving at the request of the Company as a director, manager, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited liability company, corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise (collectively, along with the current and former Manager and officers of the Company, such persons are referred to as "_ **Covered Persons** _"), in each of those capacities, against any and all losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines or liabilities, including reasonable legal fees or other expenses incurred in investigating or defending against such losses, claims, damages, judgments, fines or liabilities, and any amounts expended in settlement of any claims (collectively, "_ **Indemnity Losses** _") that may be incurred by them in connection with or resulting from (a) any threatened, pending, or completed action, suit, or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative, arbitrative, or investigative (collectively, a "_ **Proceeding** _"), (b) an appeal in such a Proceeding, or (c) any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, all to the fullest extent permitted by Chapter 8 of the Business Code. The Company shall pay or reimburse, in advance of the final disposition of the Proceeding, to all persons who are or were a Manager or officer of the Company all reasonable expenses incurred by such person who was, is, or is threatened to be made a named defendant or respondent in a Proceeding to the fullest extent permitted by Chapter 8 of the Business Code. The Company may indemnify persons who are or were an employee or agent (other than a Manager or officer) of the Company, or persons who are not or were not employees or agents of the Company but who are or were serving at the request of the Company as a director, manager, officer, trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign or domestic limited liability company, corporation, trust, partnership, joint venture, sole proprietorship, employee benefit plan, or other enterprise (collectively, along with the Covered Persons, such persons are referred to herein as "_ **Corporate Functionaries** _") against any and all Indemnity Losses that may be incurred by them in connection with or resulting from (x) any Proceeding, (y) an appeal in such a Proceeding, or (z) any inquiry or investigation that could lead to such a Proceeding, all to the fullest extent permitted by Chapter 8 of the Business Code. The rights of indemnification provided for in this ARTICLE VIII shall be in addition to all rights to which any Corporate Functionary may be entitled under any agreement or vote of Members or as a matter of law or otherwise.

**Insurance**. The Company may purchase or maintain insurance on behalf of any Corporate Functionary against any Indemnity Losses asserted against him and incurred by him in such a capacity or arising out of his status as a Corporate Functionary, whether or not the Company would have the power to indemnify him against such Indemnity Losses under the Business Code or this Agreement; provided, however, that if the insurance or other arrangement is with a person or entity that is not regularly engaged in the business of providing insurance coverage, the insurance or arrangement may provide for payment of any Indemnity Losses with respect to which the Company would not have the power to indemnify the person only if including coverage for the additional Indemnity Losses have been approved by the Managers. Without limiting the power of the Company to procure or maintain any kind of insurance or arrangement, the Company may, for the benefit of persons indemnified by the Company, (a) create a trust fund, (b) establish any form of self-insurance, (c) secure its indemnification obligation by grant of any security interest or other lien on the assets of the Company, or (d) establish a letter of credit, guaranty, or surety arrangement. Any such insurance or other arrangement may be procured, maintained, or established within the Company or its Affiliates or with any insurer or other person deemed appropriate by the Managers regardless of whether all or part of the stock or other securities thereof are owned in whole or in part by the Company. In the absence of fraud, the judgment of the Managers as to the terms and conditions of such insurance or other arrangement and the identity of the insurer or other person participating in an arrangement shall be conclusive, and the insurance or arrangement shall not be voidable and shall not subject the Managers to liability, on any ground, regardless of whether the Managers shall be a beneficiary thereof.

**Savings Clause**. If this ARTICLE VIII or any portion hereof shall be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the Company shall nevertheless indemnify hold harmless, defend, pay and reimburse each Corporate Functionary as to Indemnity Losses with respect to any Proceeding, to the fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this ARTICLE VIII that shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

**Exceptions**. Notwithstanding any provision of this ARTICLE VIII to the contrary, a Corporate Functionary shall only be entitled to indemnification if (a) such Corporate Functionary acted in good faith and in a manner believed by such Corporate Functionary to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful, and (b) such Corporate Functionary's conduct did not constitute fraud, gross negligence or willful misconduct, in either case as determined by a final, nonappealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction.

**Reimbursement**. The Company shall promptly reimburse (and/or advance to the extent reasonably required) each Corporate Functionary for reasonable legal or other expenses (as incurred) of such Corporate Functionary in connection with investigating, preparing to defend or defending any Proceeding relating to any Indemnity Losses for which such Corporate Functionary may be indemnified pursuant to this ARTICLE VIII; provided, that if it is finally judicially determined that such Corporate Functionary is not entitled to the indemnification provided by Section 8.4, then such Corporate Functionary shall promptly reimburse the Company for any such reimbursed or advanced expenses.

 TAXES

**Tax Returns**. The Managers shall cause to be prepared and filed all necessary federal and state income tax returns for the Company, including making the elections described in Section 9.2. Each Member shall furnish to the Managers all pertinent information in its possession relating to Company operations that is necessary to enable the Company's income tax returns to be prepared and filed.

**Tax Elections**. The Company shall make the following elections on the appropriate tax returns:

    1.
### to adopt the calendar year (or such other year as may be determined by the Managers from time to time) as the Company's fiscal year;
    2.
### if a distribution of Company property as described in Section 734 of the Code occurs or if a Transfer of a Membership Interest as described in Section 743 of the Code occurs, on written request of any Member and in the discretion of the Managers, to elect, pursuant to Section 754 of the Code, to adjust the basis of Company properties;
    3.
### to elect to currently deduct or to amortize the organizational expenses of the Company and the startup expenditures of the Company ratably as permitted under Section 195 and Section 709 of the Code; and
    4.
### any other election including whether the Company shall adopt a cash or accrual method of accounting as the Managers may deem appropriate and in the best interests of the Members.

Neither the Company nor any Manager or Member may make an election for the Company to be excluded from the application of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Code or any similar provisions of applicable state law, and no provision of this Agreement (including Section 2.7) shall be construed to sanction or approve such an election.

**Partnership Representative**. De Jean shall be designated as the initial partnership representative under Section 6223 of the Code (the "_ **Partnership Representative** _"). The Managers may change or otherwise designate the Partnership Representative as permitted by the Code. The Partnership Representative shall be reimbursed by the Company for all expenses incurred in connection with all examinations of the Company's affairs by tax authorities and is authorized to expend Company funds for professional services and costs associated therewith. Each Member hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company from and against any liability with respect to its share of any tax deficiency paid or payable by the Company that is allocable to the Member (as reasonably determined by the Managers) with respect to an audited or reviewed taxable year for which such Member was a Member in the Company (for the avoidance of doubt, including any applicable interest and penalties). Each Member will provide such cooperation and assistance, including executing and filing forms or other statements and providing information about the Member, as is reasonably requested by the Partnership Representative, as applicable, to enable the Company to satisfy any applicable tax reporting or compliance requirements, to make any tax election or to qualify for an exception from or reduced rate of tax or other tax benefit or be relieved of liability for any tax regardless of whether such requirement, tax benefit or tax liability existed on the date such Member was admitted to the Company. If a Member fails to provide any such forms, statements, or other information requested by the Partnership Representative, as applicable, such Member will be required to indemnify the Company for the share of any tax deficiency paid or payable by the Company that is due to such failure (as reasonably determined by the Managers). The obligations set forth in this Section 9.3 will survive such Member's ceasing to be a Member in the Company and/or the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Company.

#
 BOOKS, RECORDS, REPORTS, AND BANK ACCOUNTS

**Maintenance of Books**. The Company shall keep books and records of accounts and shall keep minutes of the proceedings of its Members, the Managers, and any committee.

 WINDING UP, LIQUIDATION, AND TERMINATION

**Events Requiring Winding Up**.

    1.
### The Company shall wind up its business and affairs upon the first to occur of the following:

      1.
#### the unanimous consent of the Managers and the Members; or
      2.
#### entry of a decree of judicial dissolution of the Company under Section 11.314 of the Business Code.
    2.
### The event in subsection (a)(i) of this Section 11.1 shall cease to be an event requiring winding up if that decision is revoked in accordance with Section 11.4.

**Liquidation and Termination**. If the business and affairs of the Company are to be wound up, the Managers shall act as liquidator or may appoint one or more Members as liquidator. The liquidator shall proceed diligently to wind up the affairs of the Company and make final distributions as provided herein and in the Business Code. The costs of liquidation shall be borne as a Company expense. Until final distribution, the liquidator shall continue to operate the Company properties with all of the power and authority of the Managers. The steps to be accomplished by the liquidator are as follows:

    1.
### as promptly as possible after an event requiring winding up and again after final liquidation, the liquidator shall cause a proper accounting to be made of the Company's assets, liabilities, and operations through the last day of the calendar month in which the event requiring winding up occurs or the final liquidation is completed, as applicable;
    2.
### the liquidator shall cause the notice described in Section 11.052 of the Business Code to be mailed to each known creditor of and claimant against the Company in the manner described in such Section 11.052;
    3.
### the liquidator shall pay, satisfy, or discharge from Company funds all of the debts, liabilities, and obligations of the Company (including all expenses incurred in liquidation and any advances described in Section 4.4) or otherwise make adequate provision for payment and discharge thereof (including the establishment of a cash escrow fund for contingent liabilities in such amount and for such term as the liquidator may reasonably determine); and
    4.
### all remaining assets of the Company shall be distributed to the Members as follows:

      1.
#### the liquidator may sell any or all Company property, including to Members, and any resulting Profit or Loss from each sale shall be computed and allocated to the Capital Accounts of the Members;
      2.
#### with respect to all Company property that has not been sold, the fair market value of that property shall be determined and the Capital Accounts of the Members shall be adjusted to reflect the manner in which the unrealized Profit, Loss, income, gain, loss, and deduction inherent in property that has not previously been reflected in the Capital Accounts would be allocated among the Members if there were a taxable disposition of that property for the fair market value of that property on the date of distribution and any other adjustments to the Capital Account of the Members shall be made for the taxable year of the Company in which such liquidation occurs such that the Capital Account of each Member prior to the distributions contemplated in Section 11.2(d)(iii) equals (to the extent possible) the distribution to be received by such Member pursuant to Section 11.2(d)(iii); and
      3.
#### Company property shall be distributed among the Members in accordance with Section 5.2(a), and those distributions shall be made by the end of the taxable year of the Company during which the liquidation of the Company occurs (or, if later, 90 days after the date of the liquidation).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liquidator may place in escrow a reserve of cash or other assets of the Company for contingent liabilities in an amount determined by the liquidator to be appropriate for such purposes. All distributions in kind to the Members shall be made subject to the liability of each distributee for costs, expenses, and liabilities theretofore incurred or for which the Company has committed prior to the date of termination and those costs, expenses, and liabilities shall be allocated to the distributee pursuant to this Section 11.2. The distribution of cash and/or property to a Member in accordance with the provisions of this Section 11.2 constitutes a complete distribution to the Member with respect to its Membership Interest and the Member's interest in the Company's property, and constitutes a compromise to which all Members have consented within the meaning of the Business Code. To the extent that a Member returns funds to the Company, it has no claim against any other Member for those funds.

**Deficit Capital Account**. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and notwithstanding any custom or rule of law to the contrary, if any Member has a negative balance in its Capital Account on the date of the liquidation of such Member's "interest in the partnership" (within the meaning of Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) of the Treasury Regulations) after taking into account allocations of Profits, Losses, and other items of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit, and distributions of cash or property (in each case as provided in ARTICLE V), that Member shall have no obligation to restore the negative balance or to make any Capital Contribution by reason thereof, and the negative balance shall not be considered an asset or a liability of the Company or of any Member.

**Certificate of Termination**. On completion of the winding up and distribution of Company assets as provided herein, the Company is terminated, the Managers (or such other Person or Persons as the Business Code may require or permit) shall file a Certificate of Termination with the Secretary of State of Texas, cancel any other filings made pursuant to Section 2.5, and take such other actions as may be necessary to terminate the Company.To the extent permitted by the Business Code, after the termination of the Company, the Person or Persons who or which were at least a Simple Majority immediately before the termination may agree or consent in writing to reinstate the Company in accordance with Subchapter E of Chapter 11 of the Business Code.

 GENERAL PROVISIONS

**Offset**. Whenever the Company is to pay or distribute any sum to any Member, any amounts that Member owes the Company may be deducted from that sum before payment or distribution is made to that Member.

**Notices**. Except as expressly set forth to the contrary in this Agreement, all notices, requests, or consents provided for or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and must be given either by depositing that writing in the United States mail, addressed to the recipient, postage paid, and registered or certified with return receipt requested, or by delivering that writing to the recipient in person, by courier, by facsimile transmission, or by electronic mail; and a notice, request, or consent given under this Agreement is effective on receipt by the Person to receive it. All notices, requests, and consents to be sent to a Member must be sent to or made at the addresses given for that Member on Exhibit A or such other address as that Member may specify by notice to the other Members. Unless otherwise specified in this Agreement or otherwise permitted by the Managers, any notice, request, or consent to the Company or the Managers must be given to the Managers at the principal office of the Company. Whenever any notice is required to be given by law, the Certificate, or this Agreement, a written waiver thereof, signed by the Person entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice.

**Entire Agreement**. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the Members and their Affiliates relating to the Company and supersedes all prior contracts or agreements of the Members and their Affiliates with respect to the Company, whether oral or written. However, nothing herein shall preclude some or all of the Members from entering into one or more separate agreements concerning voting, ownership, and Transfer of Units or shall preclude the Company from becoming a party to any such agreement.

**Effect of Waiver or Consent**. A waiver or consent, express or implied, to or of any breach or default by any Person in the performance by that Person of its obligations under this Agreement or with respect to the Company is not a consent to or waiver of any other breach or default in the performance by that Person of the same or any other obligations of that Person under this Agreement or with respect to the Company. Failure on the part of a Person to complain of any act of any Person or to declare any Person in default with respect to this Agreement or the Company, irrespective of how long that failure continues, does not constitute a waiver by that Person of its rights with respect to that default until the applicable statute-of-limitations period has run.

**Amendment or Modification**. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may be amended or modified from time to time only by a written instrument executed and agreed to by the Managers and a Simple Majority, except for any provision for which the approval of a different specified portion of the Sharing Ratios of all Members entitled to vote is expressly required by this Agreement; provided, however, that (a) an amendment or modification negatively and disproportionately affecting any Member's rights or benefits hereunder (including a material and disproportionate decrease in such Member's Sharing Ratio), is effective only with that Member's consent, and (b) an amendment or modification reducing the required Sharing Ratio or other measure for any consent or vote in this Agreement is effective only with the consent or vote of Members having the Sharing Ratio or other measure theretofore required. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Managers may amend this Agreement without the consent of any Member (x) to the limited extent necessary to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any provision hereof that may be incomplete or inconsistent with any other provision hereof, so long as such amendment under this clause does not materially and adversely affect the interests of the Members; and (y) to reflect any additional Capital Contributions, or any valid admission of additional Members or valid Transfer of Units pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

### Good Faith Negotiations. The parties shall endeavor, in good faith, to resolve the Dispute through negotiations within a reasonable time (which, in any event shall not be greater than ten (10) Business Days).
    2.
### Mediation. In the event that the negotiations do not result in a mutually acceptable resolution, either party may require that the Dispute shall be referred to mediation in Collin County, Texas.

### Arbitration. In the event the parties are unsuccessful in their mediation of the Dispute, or if there is any Dispute about the scope of or the compliance by any party with this Section 12.10, either party may request that the Dispute be finally settled by arbitration before a single JAMS arbitrator in Collin County, Texas.

The parties on behalf of each of themselves and each of their prospective executors, administrators, successors, and assigns, are required to submit to the jurisdiction of that court. The parties shall share equally the fees and costs of JAMS and the arbitrator; provided, however, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover such fees and costs from the non-prevailing party, in an amount to be determined in the discretion of the arbitrator. Additionally, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its reasonable fees and expenses of counsel and experts (including the costs to enforce or preserve the rights awarded in the arbitration) from the non-prevailing party in an amount to be determined in the discretion of the arbitrator. Notwithstanding the foregoing, and pursuant to Section 12.7, the parties may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for injunctive relief without breach of this Section 12.10, and this Section 12.10, shall be of no force and effect with respect to such application for injunctive relief only.

To the fullest extent permitted by law, each Member shall indemnify the Company, the Managers, and each other Member and hold them harmless from and against all losses, costs, liabilities, damages, and expenses (including costs of suit and attorney's fees) they may incur on account of any breach by such breaching Member of this Agreement.
